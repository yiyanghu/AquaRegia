AquaRegia
=========

AquaRegia aims to b a multisignature Bitcoin wallet. Currently it supports only
 regular address holding. Sending to P2SH multisigature addresses 
(34PTJeM3gtGSk3fqAJ4iWcEsbip46cbDVw) should work. Only the beginnings of multisignature 
address support are being worked on in the code.
