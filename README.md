# AquaRegia

AquaRegia aims to be a multisignature Bitcoin wallet. Currently it supports only
 regular address holding. Sending to P2SH multisigature addresses 
(ex: 3PyvUN6JNt4ASq264P9kdU8pjNSKKU8n7p [don't send] ) should work. Only the beginnings of multisignature 
address support are being worked on in the code.

## Building
